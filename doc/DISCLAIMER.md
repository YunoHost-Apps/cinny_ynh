* The app only supports being installed at the root of a domain. This is an upstream limitation.
    * ok:Â mydomain.org/
    * ok: cinny.mydomain.org/
    * NOT ok: mydomain.org/cinny

* There's no LDAP support (and never will be).
* Cinny only is a client, you need to have an account on a server already (see the Synapse Yunohost app)
